# NO CODE MACHINE LEARNING PLATFORM

A **streamlit based Machine learning platform** that allows users to view Data, clean data, visualized it, train them , compare two models and evaluate its performance. User can also predict on new dataset. They can also use save they model and use it to predict data.This project is designed to simulate real world ML workflow.

## ALGORITHMS USED:
-using scratch
  -Linear Regression
  -Binary Classification
  -Multiclass classsification(Shallow NN)
  -Kmeans
  -Anomaly Detection(Gaussian)
  -Decision-tree
-using sklearn
  -Linear Regression
  -Binary Classification
  -Multiclass Classification(Shallow NN)
  -Kmeans
  -Decision-tree
  -Randomforest
  -xgboost

## Key Features:
   ### Train-your-model
   -Data preview - View your dataset and summary of your dataset.
   -Cleaning - clean your dataset like remove duplicates, encode categorical values, fill missing values, etc. Also have feature of feature transformation.
   -Visualization - Visualize your dataset in four forms - scatterplot, histogram, boxplot, and heatmap.
   -Standardization - Standardize your dataset.
   -Training - select the Algorithm_type, Model_type and Implementation_type and set parameters to train models and can also train two models and compare them.
   -Testing - Test you model on X_test.
   -Prediction - Predict a dataset based on the model trained and download it.
